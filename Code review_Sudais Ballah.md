**Code Review of Sudais Ballah‚Äôs Week 6 Lab**  
**By: [Elias Adjetey](mailto:elias.adjetey@amalitechtraining.org)**

**‚úÖ What you did well:**

* The project correctly uses a microservice architecture with logical service boundaries.  
* The core infrastructure, including the discovery-server, config-server and api-gateway is set up correctly.  
* The services correctly use DTOs for data transfer. Also, DTOs are properly annotated to validate inputs.  
* The project implements a global exception handler which handles exceptions accurately including custom exceptions.  
* The use of kafka for asynchronous communication is well implemented demonstrating solid understanding of event-driven architecture.  
* The addition of refresh token mechanism in auth-service is commendable as it improves session longevity and user experience.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Areas you can improve:**

* The register-admin endpoint in the auth-service is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to create an administrator.   
  **Action**: The endpoint must either be removed or secured to require existing administrative privileges for access.   
* The restaurant service layer lacks transactional management which can lead to data inconsistency if an operation fails midway.   
  **Action**: All service methods that perform database write operations must have the @Transactional annotation.  
* The jwt secret is hardcoded in plaintext in the config-repo‚Äôs auth-service.properties file which is a critical security vulnerability.   
  **Action**: Hardcoded sensitive data must be replaced with environment variables.  
* While asynchronous communication worked, some message processing logic could be made more defensive.   
  **Action**: Incoming events must be verified to ensure data integrity.

**üí°Suggestions for future work**:

* Add `Resilience4j` circuit breakers and fallback methods to handle service failures gracefully.  
* Integrate distributed tracing  e.g. `Zipkin` for better observability.  
* Explore containerization with Docker compose to simulate deployment in a production-like environment.
